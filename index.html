                    Hatha Yoga is a branch of Yoga that focuses on physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation to promote overall health and wellbeing. The word “Hatha” is derived from the Sanskrit words “ha” and “tha,” which mean “sun” and “moon,” respectively, and symbolize the balance of opposing forces within the body. Hatha Yoga is often practiced for its physical benefits, including improved flexibility, muscle strength, and balance. Still, it also profoundly affects the mind and can help reduce stress and promote emotional regulation.

                            Studies have shown that Hatha Yoga can positively impact cognitive functioning, including improved memory, attention, and executive function. Regular practice can help to increase blood flow to the brain, stimulate the growth of new neural connections, and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.<br>
